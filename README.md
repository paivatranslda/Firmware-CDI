# HONDA NSR125 / CRM125 - PROGRAMABLE CDI + RC Control
DIY Reprogramable CDI / RC Control Replacement
DIY Honda NSR125RR / CRM125R Programable CDI based on Thierry own design, Transmic AC CDI V7  https://transmic.net/16628_v7/ACCDI16F628v79r20c0.pdf from https://transmic.net .
Thierry made a generic PIC16 based programable diy cdi, and I pretend to make a version for HONDA NSR125RR model.

1- A word of thanks to Thierry for let me use is own design.
2- My acknowledge is limited, so help needed if someone is interested. 
3- With NSR125/CRM125, Transmic AC CDI work OK but OEM RC VALVE control will not work with it, for a street 2-strokes 125cc, losting RC Valve capability isnÂ´t acceptable for power band control. - This is not true with 2-strokes racing engines.
  
  
  Work Points:
    Find one standard aluminium box. Yes aluminium, I like recyclable materials.
    Leave option for use OEM connectors or new modern waterproof connectors
    Would be nice to design a new and improved 3 Phase DC Retifier. / Later 
    
  PCB Design
    Standard size to fit inside a aluminium box.
    4 holes for fixing on box and electric ground 
  
  Circuit Design
    Use MAX9926 insted of inversed signal transistors for VR sensor reading.
    Use high eficient DC-DC conversor for Power Supply.
    Use TB6612FNG H-Bridge controller or other MOSFET based controller. / Leave L298N Alone
    Use daugther PIC12F638 for control RC valve seperated from PIC16F628A.

   RC VALVE Morphlogy
    RC Valve is one analog servo alike system conteined in a plastic box.
    It got one motor with some redutor gears atached, one 15Kohm Variable Resistor conect to the end shaft ( just like servo's) and outside at the end  of the shaft one rond cable suport.
    It works by open and close RC Valve throw a dual cable system.
    Now, the RC controller is a very rudentary, analog only circuit inside a CDI alike box.
